Vitals
======

Vitals is a Timer/Watchface Pebble App assisting Nurses in measuring the heart rate of their patients.

When you start to measure the patient's heart rate, press the middle button to start the timer.  There will be a brief delay allowing you to get ready.  The watch will vibrate at the start of the timer, signaling you to begin counting the patient's pulse.  Once the timer has finished, the watch will vibrate again, signaling the end of the timer.  During this time, only the seconds hand will appear on the watch face showing the timer's current value.  The watch's backlight will also remain on for the full duration of the timer.

When in the non-timer mode, this app will show an analog watchface, displaying the day-of-week and day.  The date will change locations on the display making it unobstructed by the watch hands.

There are 3 settings you can change: Heart Beat Count Time, Start Delay, and Vibration.  To change the settings perform a "long press" of the Middle Button to bring up the settings screen.

Special Thanks to Janette L, RN for her testing and encouragement.
